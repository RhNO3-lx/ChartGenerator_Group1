Generate a text image with the content of "App Store Growth: Google vs. iOS (2009-2013)". Create a text image with the title "App Store Growth: Google vs. iOS (2009-2013)" split into three lines for clarity: 

1. Let the first line read, "App Store Growth:" in a bold, prominent font.
2. The second line should be "Google vs. iOS" in a slightly smaller size but still noticeable. 
3. The third line will simply state "(2009-2013)" in a more understated way.

Emphasize the key phrases "App Store Growth" and "Google vs. iOS" by enlarging their font size and changing the color to a deep blue for the first line and a rich green for the second line, thereby highlighting their importance in the context of the title.

For decoration, I recommend adding graphics around the text. Use an illustration of a mobile phone icon integrated into the letter "o" of "Google," allowing the circular shape of the letter to seamlessly incorporate the icon, symbolizing the app store within the smartphone. 

In terms of font style, choose a modern sans-serif font for a clean and contemporary look, ensuring legibility and a professional feel. Apply a subtle drop shadow to the text to create a sense of depth and make it more visually striking against the background.
