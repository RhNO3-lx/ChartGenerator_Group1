Generate a text image with the content of "Average Commute Times by Transportation Mode". Generate an image with the text layout split into two lines: 

1. The first line reads "Average Commute Times" with an emphasis on "Average" and "Commute" by enlarging the font size and using a vibrant blue color. 
2. The second line reads "by Transportation Mode" in a more subtle, smaller font size, maintaining a dark gray color for contrast.

Enhance the design by replacing the letter "o" in "Transportation" with an icon of a small train, positioned centrally to maintain balance and draw attention.

For font style, use a modern sans-serif typeface that conveys clarity and contemporary appeal. Apply a subtle shadow effect to create depth in the text, making it visually engaging without being overwhelming.
