Generate a text image with the content of "Commute Times by Transportation Mode". Commute Times  
by Transportation  
Mode  

The first line "Commute Times" should be emphasized by using a bold sans-serif font with a subtle distressed texture effect in pink color. The second line "by Transportation" and the third line "Mode" will be in a regular sans-serif weight with a clean white color. The entire text will be center-aligned.

To enhance the design, a bicycle icon will replace the letter "o" in the word "Mode." This icon will be styled to match the contemporary feel of the text, incorporating colors that harmonize with the overall color scheme, ensuring it feels cohesive with the rest of the text.

For the font style, a modern sans-serif typeface will be chosen for its simplicity and readability, contributing to a clean and engaging aesthetic.
