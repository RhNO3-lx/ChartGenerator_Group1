Generate a text image with the content of "Average Commute Times by Transportation Mode". The title "Average Commute Times by Transportation Mode" should be designed as follows:

The text will be split into three lines, center-aligned for balanced visual appeal. 

1. The first line will read "Average Commute Times," which will be the main emphasis.
2. The second line will contain the words "by Transportation," which will be secondary and less emphasized.
3. The third line will consist of the word "Mode," which will be presented with some emphasis.

To highlight the key text, "Average Commute Times" will be rendered in a bold, serif font that is both chunky and exaggerated to convey importance and visibility. "Mode" will be in the same font but might be slightly smaller to differentiate it from the main title, yet still bold enough to stand out. The color for the first line will be a warm cream white, while the second line will be a vibrant orange, and the third line "Mode" will be in a light blue to create a pleasing contrast.

For decoration, instead of standard icons, we will integrate a graphic element around the text. A subtle illustration of a city skyline featuring stylized transport elements like cars and trains will be echoed at the bottom of the text, enhancing the transport theme without overcrowding the title. This graphic will be minimalist and elegant, flowing seamlessly beneath the text, ensuring it does not distract from the main title but rather supports it.

In terms of font style, a blend of modern and vintage aesthetics will be employed, combining a bold serif typeface with angled edges that suggests movement, representative of commuting. The text will also feature a smooth, clean look without unnecessary embellishments, focusing on clarity and impact.

Artistic effects will include a slight texture on the surface of the text to give it a tactile quality, resembling a brushed metal or a subtle grit, which will enhance the overall sharpness of the design without overshadowing the legibility of the text. No additional shadows or glowing effects will be present, maintaining a straightforward yet captivating presentation. 

Overall, this design will merge functionality and visual appeal, effectively communicating the title's theme while being graphically engaging.
