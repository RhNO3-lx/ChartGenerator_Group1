Generate a text image with the content of "App Store Growth: Google vs. iOS (2009-2013)". Create a text image with the title broken down into three lines as follows: 

1. Line 1: "App Store Growth"
2. Line 2: "Google vs. iOS"
3. Line 3: "(2009-2013)"

Emphasize the key text "App Store Growth" by enlarging the font size and changing its color to a vibrant blue. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for a contemporary feel. For decoration, incorporate a subtle icon of a smartphone integrated into the letter "o" in "Google," replacing the letter's round shape with the icon while maintaining the overall readability. Surround the text with minimal stylized graphics representing app icons and upward growth arrows to signify growth, positioned subtly at the corners without overwhelming the text.

Opt for a futuristic font style to reflect the technological context, and apply a slight glow effect around the letters to add depth and make them stand out.
