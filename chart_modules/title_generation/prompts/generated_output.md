Generate a text image with the content of "California drought conditions 2000-2025. Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of severe droughts and wildfires in California through rising temperatures, drier conditions, and more extreme weather patterns.". Create a text image with the following layout: The main title "California drought conditions 2000-2025" should be presented prominently on the first line, using an enlarged font size and bold typeface for emphasis. The subsequent text, "Climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of severe droughts and wildfires in California through rising temperatures, drier conditions, and more extreme weather patterns," will be split into three lines for clarity, with normal font size and a clean typeface. The key text to emphasize is "California drought conditions 2000-2025," highlighted through an increase in font size and a distinct orange hue, contrasting against the rest of the text which will be in a slightly muted gray color.

To enhance the visual appeal, incorporate graphics of temperature icons (such as a thermometer) flanking the title "California drought conditions 2000-2025." Place one icon to the left and one to the right of the title, as if they are supporting it. These icons should be simple and stylized, perhaps in a gradient of red to yellow to suggest heat, providing a thematic connection to drought conditions.

For the font style, choose a modern, sans-serif typeface to convey a sense of urgency and contemporary relevance. Additionally, apply an artistic effect of a slight dry, cracked surface to the title text to symbolize the effects of drought, while maintaining a clean appearance overall. The cracks should be subtle but noticeable, suggesting the impact without overwhelming the text.
