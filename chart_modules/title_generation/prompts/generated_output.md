The title will be split into three lines with the first line focusing on the primary concept "Average Commute," the second line emphasizing "Times by," and the third line detailing "Transportation Mode." The text is left-aligned for a professional appearance. The key text "Average Commute" will be emphasized by enlarging the font size significantly to draw attention, while retaining a classic serif font for an authoritative look. The remaining parts of the title will be in a regular-sized sans-serif font to contrast but maintain clarity.  

To enhance the visual interest, the icon of a small train will replace the letter "T" in the word "Transportation." This will add a thematic decoration that resonates with the subject of commuting. The train icon will be designed in a simple, monochrome style to keep it professional and blend well with the text.  

For font style, a combination of a bold serif for the first two lines and a clean sans-serif typeface for the last line will be utilized to maintain a modern appearance while ensuring readability. There will be no artistic effects applied; the focus will remain on clear communication without distractions from shadows or outlines. The design will adhere to a modern and professional aesthetic, ensuring clarity and readability throughout.
