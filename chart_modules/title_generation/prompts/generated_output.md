The text is center-aligned and divided into two lines. The first line features the four words "Global Space Funding," while the second line consists of the seven words "by Country, 2023." The font is a modern, sans-serif typeface that is bold, ensuring high readability and a professional appearance. The text color is dark gray, providing strong contrast against the light background. For emphasis, the entire first line should be slightly larger than the second line to highlight its importance. 

To enhance the visual appeal without clutter, decorative elements will be incorporated with a minimalist approach: an icon of a rocket will be used to replace the letter "o" in "Global." This icon will blend seamlessly into the text, maintaining the overall modern aesthetic. 

The design embraces a clean, straightforward style that focuses on professional clarity, appropriate for an analytical context with no additional effects such as shadows or outlines. It emphasizes a strong focus on content while ensuring the poster remains visually appealing and informative.
